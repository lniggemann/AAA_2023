## /trips
Contains prepared main dataset of taxi rides (Chicago 2014) 

IMPORTANT: 
Note: As discussed in http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2019/07/01/taxi-dataset-relaunch.html, some trips in November-December 2014 are known to be missing. --Taxi trips reported to the City of Chicago in its role as a regulatory agency.  To protect privacy but allow for aggregate analyses, the Taxi ID is consistent for any given taxi medallion number but does not show the number, Census Tracts are suppressed in some cases, and times are rounded to the nearest 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nDue to the data reporting process, not all trips are reported but the City believes that most are.\r\n\r\nSee http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/chicago-taxi-data-released for more information about this dataset and how it was created.\r\n\r\nSee http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2019/04/12/tnp-taxi-privacy.html for further discussion of the approach to privacy in this dataset.\r\n\r\nSee http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2019/07/01/taxi-dataset-relaunch.html for discussion of significant changes in July 2019.",
